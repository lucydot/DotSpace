push onto kelvin
create directory for a single run and save all files in there
correlation length testing
**input file
overlay multiple layers (3rd / 4th) - agnostic to the actual order
**Abbreviating sequences of multiple zeros - 7x0 2x1 6x0 
**possible to input break points in same way as basic - 7x0 b 3x0 b
(make sure to keep previous notation)
**different basic series in different layers
**issue with rotating - break points. the break points are irrespective of the layer being done. the break points shouldn't rotate. 
ULAM version - start in the middle and go outwards - with option for E/S/W/N beginning and running clockwise from this. (actually, this is just a rotation at thend of that layer creation) - only true for odd squares.
rectangle grids not square grids.
**output image with greater resolution - just change the size of the matplotlib figure? - change the dpi of the image.
