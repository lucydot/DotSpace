ULAM version - start in the middle and go outwards - with option for E/S/W/N beginning and running clockwise from this. (actually, this is just a rotation at thend of that layer creation) - only true for odd squares.** question how do you want the defects defined? as previous??
rectangle grids not square grids**.

Abbreviating sequences of multiple zeros - 7x0 2x1 6x0  DONE
possible to input break points in same way as basic - 7x0 b 3x0 b DONE
(make sure to keep previous notation)
create directory for a single run and save all files in there DONE
input file DONE
overlay multiple layers (3rd / 4th) - agnostic to the actual order . DONE
different basic series in different layers DONE
issue with rotating - break points. the break points are irrespective of the layer being done. the break points shouldn't rotate. DONE
output image with greater resolution - just change the size of the matplotlib figure? - change the dpi of the image. or try .eps??? DONE MAYBE??
