# dot-space
Dotty for Space code
Written by Lucy Whalley (github: lucydot) to analyse Dot-Space 
drawings by Richard Scott (richard-md-scott.tumblr.com).   

dotspace.py makes use of numba (http://numba.pydata.org/)
for faster calculations. If you do not have this installed 
then use dotspace_nojit.py.
Other dependancies are: numpy, matplotlib, iPython, 
argparse, time.

"Whether obvious or subtle, visible or elusive, these         
symmetries are inherent and real."
